In addition to the data collected by all Test Pilot experiments, here are the key things you should know about what is happening when you use No More 404s:

* We collect basic usage on how many times you encounter a Page Not Found error (code 404), how many times Firefox shows you that a cached page exists from Archive.org, and how many times you click to view a cached version of a broken page. 

* We DO NOT collect the actual URLs of any pages you request. We also DO NOT collect the URLs we send to Archive.org

* To provide cached versions of pages not found, we send 404 error page URLs to Archive.org. We send these requests to Archive.org through Mozillaâ€™s servers, so they will not be associated with you.
